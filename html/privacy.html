                            disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative, physical and technical measures such as
                            minimised collection of personal data, authentication and access controls (such as good password practices,
                            need-to-basis for data disclosure, etc.), encryption of data, up-to-date antivirus protection, regular patching of
                            operating system and other software, securely erase storage media in devices before disposal, web security measures
                            against risks, and security review and testing performed regularly.
